# KerbalTool
A calculator tool for Kerbal Space Program

By opening Orbital_Calculator.py, you should get a tkinter interface with calculations and stuff.
I think it works pretty okay but this was my first time using tkinter so yeah idk how good it really is.
It's mainly for myself (i play a lot of kerbal space program) but you're all welcome to use it (if you can get it to work).
You're also welcome to send me your full address.
